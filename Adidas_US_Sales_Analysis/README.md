Adidas US Sales Data Fun! ðŸ“Š
Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ This little project is all about diving into some Adidas sales data from the US and seeing what cool insights we can find. It's super chill, just a peek into how a popular brand sells its awesome stuff across the country!

What's Inside? ðŸ“‚
Adidas US Sales Datasets.xlsx - Data Sales Adidas.csv: This is our main star! It's a spreadsheet packed with all the juicy details about Adidas sales. You'll find info like:

Retailer: Who's selling the goods.
Invoice Date: When the magic happened.
Region, State, City: Where the sales went down.
Product: What awesome Adidas gear was sold.
Price per Unit, Units Sold, Total Sales: The numbers game!

Adidas_US_sales.ipynb: This is your friendly neighborhood Jupyter Notebook! ðŸ““ It's where the data comes to life. I used it to:

Clean up the raw data (because raw data can be a bit messy sometimes!).
Break down sales by year, month, and day for some cool time-based insights.
Visualize retailer performance and market share to see who's rocking it the most!
Where Did This Data Come From? ðŸ¤”
